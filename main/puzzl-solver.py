#this is basic idea
# - identify locations of the first two pieces
# - move to center (e.g. is on side, spin 2x2 until in, if already in position, dont touch)
# - shift up, spin into position
# - continue until solved

# #We should create like a Tkinter GUI for this
#like for entering the current position
